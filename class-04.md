## HTML & CSS By Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)**

- links within HTML are used to move from one webpage to another, or just other pages of the same website.
- `<a href="http://www.coolwebpage.totallyrealurl">A coolwebpage</a>` this is an absolute URL which links to another website
- `<a href="about.html">about</a>` Is a relative URL which links to another page of the same website.
- you can open a url in a new window like so `<a href="A URL GOES HERE" target-"_blank">`

### **Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)**

- CSS treats all HTML elements as if its in its own box, these will either be block level or an inline box.
- If one block level elements sits inside another BL element the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
- CSS has a few different positioning schemes. Normal flow, Relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floating elements.
- the z- index value controls the forward to backward positioning.
- the float property allows you to take an element and place it as far to the left or right of its containing element as possible.
- most webpages use wither a fixed layout which will not adjust as a user changes their window size, or a liquid layout, which will stretch and move with adjustments in browser window.

## JS & Jquery By Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)**

- a function allows you to group together statements to perform a tast. If you need to repeat this task you can simply recall the function in future code.

- `function myFunction() { the code to execute;}`
- functions can take in arguments and parameters to be applied in the code block.
- the return keyword allows a function to return a single value.
- you can return multiple values from a function by storing the values inside an array, and returning the array.

- Pair programming generally uses a driver and a navigator, The driver is typing the code, and the navigator guides the codes creation
- pair programming creates a circle of feedback and continuous communication which helps to create clean, functional code
- research shows pair programming takes slightly longer to produce code, but that the code will be higher quality with less errors.
- Pair programming helps to increase focus and keep both developers more engaged.
- Everyone has different approaches to problems and this collaborative effect produces more resilient code.
