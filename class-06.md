## Understanding the problem domain . . .

- It is extremely difficult to learn while out of your comfort zone, By creating familiarity or recognizing familiarity, we can remove some blockers and focus on learning the content.
- When you break down a problem into much smaller parts it becomes more manageable. And it is easier to focus on learning/solving the small parts you know, and do understand.
- understanding the problem is the most critical part of solving the problem.

### **Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)**

- An object is a grouping of key, value pairs.
- to access a value from a object you need to know the key, And call it with dot notation.

- to use this to manipulate a webpage you must access the elements using special JS methods. `getElementByID()`
- It is possible to select elements by ID, class, type, section etc.. . .
- child, sibling, first, last . . .there are many selectors you can use within the DOM to navigate and pick out elements and objects.
- Its possible to use the DOM to add HTML to a page either on its own, or as a result of an action, like a button press.
