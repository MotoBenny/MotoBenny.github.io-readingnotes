# Django

URLs for your web app are defined within a urlpatterns variable. this contains the mapping of your desired urls.
```python 
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
    path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
    path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
]
```

Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

```python 
from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
    return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. Itâ€™s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from bands.models import Band, Member

class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
    list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
    list_filter = ('band',)

admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options
```

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.utils.translation import gettext

def homepage(request):
    """
    Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
    user's language.
    """
    message = gettext('Welcome to our site!')
    return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})
      

{% load i18n %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% trans 'Homepage - Hall of Fame' %}</title>

    {# Translated in the view: #}
