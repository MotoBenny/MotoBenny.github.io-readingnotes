# What is Jupyter Notebooks?
I've use Jupyter notebooks for the last couple years when self learning python, or in my previous certificate course. 

Ill admit that in my previous times studing python, I didnt quite get jupyter notebooks, and rather disliked the format. 

But now that I've spent more time developing I can see the benifit of the instantanious feedback that it affords. 

I look forward to seeing how we are going to use this tool in our class.

# Numpy

Is a Data Analytics module for python

We can use it to parse and work with data from CSV files. 

We can work with numpy and our CSV file to format our data however we need.

Numpy can also read directly from CSV or other files coverting them to arrays. Using genfromtxt function

Like other data structures in python numpy arrays are zero indexed

Numpy arrays accept normal methods in python liek slicing and mathamatics
