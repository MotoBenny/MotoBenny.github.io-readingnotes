# Whiteboard interviews/DSA

top tips for the whitboarding technical interview

1) communicate, talk through your proccess, discuss what your choices do and dont enable you and your code to do. "If i write this line this way, i can then do this with the result. However if this were to happen this line might limit me or need refactoring."

2) repeat the question back to the interviewer, this checks for understanding and affirms you heard and understand the problem

3) Ask about edge cases, consider the expected inputs and outputs. If you've identified the expected input/output, than you now know the edgecases! How should the algorithm handle these?

4) Ask about test cases, Are there any specific tests this algorithm should pass?
Its possible the question does not include tests, in which case, you've demonstrated your knowledge of testing and detail oriented view. 

5) when you write your pseudo code, check for understanding. "does this make sense?" Often in a whiteboard interview the pseudo code is almost more important than the actual code being functional, good robust pseudo code shows your though process and can be built off of. 

6) Once your code is finished, check if it looks good? Ask if its good, and compare the code to your notes and edge cases. If you've forgotten a specific method or some syntax, ask the interviewer for it, if they wont tell you leave it as pseudo code for the interview. 

### Most importantly
Ask about the technical interview before the interview, Get as much information as you can, what will this companies whiteboard be like? Get all the info you can and use it to prepair.

## 7 tips to help in the interview

1) take some time, Its okay to pause to consider the question. Dont try to fill silence. 

2) write down the steps to the solution, walk through the process of the algorithm

3) pseudo code first. 

4) dont sweat the small stuff, the whiteboard is a high level view of you as a programmer, forgetting certain methods is okay, just mention it, and discuss how you would find it. "id just google that method since i cant remember it right now" or simply ask the interviewer for the method you are looking for.

5) be humble, this is a learning experience, take feedback, and discuss the process. Accept and thank the interviewers for feedback and critisism 

6) practice beforehand, be as prepaired as you can be.
