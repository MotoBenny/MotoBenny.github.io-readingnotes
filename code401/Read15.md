# Trees

- A tree is a data structure, that starts at the Root, and has two 'edges' which link to a left and right node below it. 
- a leaf is a node with no children.

- the height of a tree is the number of edgfes from root to the furthest leaf.

- there are two types of traversal for trees,
	- depth first,
	- breadth first

breadth first traversal uses a queue.
placing the root at the front of the queue. and each subsiquent node behind it in the queue.

A binary tree restricts the number of children nodes to two. A left and right node. 
Trees however can. have any number of nodes.

Trees with more than 2 nodes are called Kary-trees.

Binary search trees, organize data from left to right, with the left containing the lowest values, and the right containing the higher values.
