## The terminal
The command line interfact native to my Mac. Been using this since 201 now, and feeling very comfortable, In my previous positions I used the command line and powershell daily. 


- Basic Navigation

At this point I find navigating around the terminal to be almost second nature. I dont have to consider the commands I am inputting and prefer the terminal to vanila navigation through say finder. 

I installed a new OhMyZsH skin to my terminal which displays the entire working dir that I am located in, and I absolutely love it.

- Files!

Creating and modifying directories and files within the terminal is also second nature to me at this point. 

- Manual Pages

The Manual pages! I had forgotten about this These will prove very handy in 401 I am sure. 

- Moving files

This was the refresher I needed. Having forgotten the commands to move and copy files within the terminal. I do exclusively use mkdir  and touch commands and use them daily. But now I can start coping and moving files with terminal.
