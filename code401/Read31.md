# [Beginners guide to docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

- I actually dockerized my midterm before presenting, I was attempting to have a super easy version of the tool that anyone could just turn on and use. We arent quite there, but i was able to dockerize the tool, and interact and run it within a docker container. 

- Docker behind the scenes is just linux containers - VMs running linux.
- A VENV essentially isolates your tool/application imports/packages from the rest of your machine, allowing you to install and interact with tools at a much more localized level.


# Images and containers
Where a dockerfile is the instructions for a given tool,
a Image is a version of those instructions for a specific time.
the container is the actual tool itself.


# [Django for APIs](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)

This was a really good recap for me, Its exactly what i needed, It breaks down the steps of creating a django project and more importantly for my learning style, talks about what these steps accomplish.

I've bookmarked this one for future reference as well.
