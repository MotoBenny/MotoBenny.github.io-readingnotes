# Random, Risk analysis, Test Coverage, Big O
[Random](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)

A handy python module that provides us access to many useful functions
- randint: accepts a low and high numbers and returns an int between them
- random: pass a number to multiply by and get a random num between 0 and that num
- choice: give us a random value from a sequence (list, set, tuple)
- shuffle: re-arrange a sequence in random order.
- randrange: randomy select elements from a range with (start, stop, step) args

# Risk Analysis
[Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

The probability of unwanted incidents - Risk

### Why use RA
- By analyzing the risks associated with new softwares/code/products we can mitigate negative effects they might have

### R Identification
1) business risks
2) testing risk
3) premature release risk
4) software risk

### Risk Assessment

### perspective of RA
Effect - what is the possible effect of the risk?
Cause - zero in on the possible causes for the risk
likelihood - how probable is this risk?
