# Stacks and Queues 
## RESPECT THE QUEUE
- In much the same way as the line at the DMV you dont cut the freaking LINE!

#### First In last out
Much like a stack of plates, you cant pull the plate off the bottom. It was the first plate in the stack, and all the other plates go on top of it. Inorder to get to the first plate, you gotta take all the others off the top of it. 

#### Last In First Out
Also exactly like a stack of plates, the most recent clean dish placed on top is the dish you reach for when you need a plate. You dont go to the plate 3 plates down. You take the one off the top, the last one in, the first one out. 

* Push
* Pop
* Peek
* is empty (couldnt find a P word for this one?)

- All these opperations are O(1)

#### Stacks and Queues,
Linked lists with rules,
Where a normal Linked list is like the outlaw or the loose cannon cop, who answers to no one, Stacks and Queues are sensible Churchillian folk, with rules and values.
These rules are exactly what make them unique and interesting as data structures.
