## HTML & CSS By Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)**

- It is good practice to store photos in a working dir inside your project file for your webpage.
- Use `<img src=images/filename.jpg" alt="A description of the photo" />` To add a photo. Note that the IMG tag is singular without a closing tag.
- you can specify the height and width of a image using `width="600" height="450"` inside the image tag.
- html5 introduces `<figure></figure>` tags which will bundle an image with its caption, nicely.
