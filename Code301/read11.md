Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

### 5 difference between SQL and NoSQL

 - SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
 - SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
 - SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
 - SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
 - SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

### Give a real world example.

MS-SQL Server Express Edition

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).

### Give a real world example.

MongoDB

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL

### What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

### What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. i.e users - orders - products

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-Many

### What is a ‘schema’?

Schema can be thought of as a structure of Fields(columns) and Records(rows.)

### What is a NoSQL database?

MongoDB

### How does it work?

With Databases containing Collections and Documents.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

Data in a format similar to JSON, Key value pairs within collections and documents. 

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB or NoSQL is more flexible, since you can store all the associated data you would need to work with your query within that item.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

No Schema, meaning the layout of data can be inconsistent.
No Relations in the data.
