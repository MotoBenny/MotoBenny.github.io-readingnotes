1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The decline of women in CS came at a time when personal PCs were growing in popularity, these PC's were marketed almost exclusively to men.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Males who grew up playing with computers entered the education space for CS with a long history of interacting and working with computers. This gave them a massive leg up in the field, and CS education was tailored to match this level of knowledge to start.

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

1. Technology as a industry has massive sexist bias to acknowledge and overcome.

2. Being a white male, I am not in a space to contribute to diversity in tech. I can however advocate for it, and acknowledge its importance and attempt to in act change wherever I may work, to encourage diversity.

3. High level leadership in government and private sectors is almost entirely male dominated. This demonstrates an extreme bias in our culture as a whole, We live and operate in a country that is at its core designed to put men in positions of power and keep them their. Anyone who is not a white male, has a massive disadvantage in their quest for success. Similar to how women in the 80's struggled in CS.

When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when driven by leadership within a company. Which of course is the same point as saying that non-diverse companies have leadership that is at best actively naive of a massive cultural issue, or at worst, intentionally fostering a non-diverse workspace.

Why do diverse companies perform better?

"in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance."

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

A diverse company will simply as a bi-product of its diversity, build a more inclusive product. This inclusive product will appeal to a wider consumer base.
