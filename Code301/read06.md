# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater Efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

For me, engaged collaboration routinely allows me to better understand and work through a problem. I also often find the way i imagine working though a problem can be needlessly complicated, and by explaining my logic to another developer, I can not only ensure understanding, but poke holes in my own design and find better ways to complete the task with their imput. 

How does pair programming work?
